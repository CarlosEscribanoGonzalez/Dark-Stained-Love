# Web Page for Multimedia Course

This web page was created for the **Multimedia** course during my first year of university. It represents my first approach to **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, built from scratch using these technologies.

### About the Project

The objective of this project was to design a web page that simulates a crowdfunding campaign for a video game, without actually developing the game itself. This experience helped me understand the fundamentals of web development and the key concepts of creating an engaging user interface.

### Features
- Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- Simulates a crowdfunding campaign for a fictional video game.
- Designed to reinforce web development skills.

### Technologies
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
